This program acts as an QMP client that communicates with QEMU to sync guest
RTC settings to host. For simplicity, the handshake phase is omitted, user
should establish the channel first and then pass the QMP pipes to the QMP
client.

Requirements:
- must run with root privilege, or it will fail to create host RTC alarms.
- there shouldn't be any other program that also manipulates host time or RTC.
- before compiling the code, run "apt install libjson-c-dev" to install libjson
